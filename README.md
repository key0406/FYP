# KOOS Progress Checker
A web-based AI system for predicting KOOS (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score).

## Overview
This project was developed as my Final Year Project at Kingston University (2023â€“2024).  
It aims to assist healthcare professionals in evaluating and predicting KOOS results using a regression-based machine learning model.

The system integrates a PHP-based web interface for patient data management and a Flask-based API for KOOS prediction, providing both usability and scalability.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap  
- **Backend:** PHP, MySQL  
- **AI Model:** Python (Scikit-learn, XGBoost)  
- **Deployment:**  
  - FileZilla (Web hosting and data management on Sakura Cloud)  
  - Render (Flask application deployment for ML model API)  
- **Version Control:** Git / GitHub  

## Features
- Digital KOOS-12 questionnaire submission and scoring  
- Machine Learning model predicts future KOOS values  
- Secure login for both doctors and patients  
- Doctor dashboard with patient trend visualization  
- AI model deployed as a Flask API accessible via web front-end  

## Achievements
- Built an integrated AI-supported healthcare web platform combining data collection, analysis, and prediction.  
- Demonstrated ability to deploy and maintain full-stack applications using cloud environments.  
- Strengthened project management and collaborative development through Agile methods.
